There are a lot of things that SQL is not: not very readable, not very concise or expressive, and not much fun to write. But if there's one thing it excels at is portability - if you can write your algorithm in it, the world is your ðŸ¦ª

This project collects different examples of writing programming logic in SQL for fun & profit:

- [Defining user-sessions from events & pageviews in SQL](user_sessions.md)

- [Aggregating data in SQL: Let's make counting harder!](aggregation_types.md)

- [Circular kernel smoothing in SQL](kernel_smoothing.md)
